/**
 * <p>
 * A {@link Map} that further provides a <i>total ordering</i> on its keys.
 * The map is ordered according to the {@linkplain Comparable natural
 * ordering} of its keys, or by a {@link Comparator} typically
 * provided at sorted map creation time.  This order is reflected when
 * iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the
 * entrySet, keySet and values methods).
 * Several additional operations are provided to take advantage of the
 * ordering.  (This interface is the map analogue of {@link
 * io.github.joealisson.primitive.sets.SortedIntSet}.)
 * </p>
 * <p>All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the Comparable
 * interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator).  Furthermore, all
 * such keys must be <i>mutually comparable</i>: k1.compareTo(k2) (or
 * comparator.compare(k1, k2)) must not throw a
 * ClassCastException for any keys k1 and k2 in
 * the sorted map.  Attempts to violate this restriction will cause the
 * offending method or constructor invocation to throw a
 * ClassCastException.
 * </p>
 * <p>Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an
 * explicit comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent with equals</i> if
 * the sorted map is to correctly implement the Map interface.  (See
 * the Comparable interface or Comparator interface for a
 * precise definition of <i>consistent with equals</i>.)  This is so because
 * the Map interface is defined in terms of the equals
 * operation, but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its
 * compareTo (or compare) method, so two keys that are
 * deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map,
 * equal.  The behavior of a tree map <i>is</i> well-defined even if its
 * ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general
 * contract of the Map interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>All general-purpose sorted map implementation classes should
 * provide four "standard" constructors: 1) A void (no arguments)
 * constructor, which creates an empty sorted map sorted according to
 * the natural ordering of its keys.  2) A constructor with a
 * single argument of type Comparator, which creates an empty
 * sorted map sorted according to the specified comparator.  3) A
 * constructor with a single argument of type Map, which
 * creates a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument,
 * sorted according to the keys' natural ordering.  4) A constructor
 * with a single argument of type SortedMap,
 * which creates a new sorted map with the same key-value mappings and
 * the same ordering as the input sorted map.  There is no way to
 * enforce this recommendation, as interfaces cannot contain
 * constructors.
 * </p>
 * <p>Note: several methods return submaps with restricted key ranges.
 * Such ranges are <i>half-open</i>, that is, they include their low
 * endpoint but not their high endpoint (where applicable).  If you need a
 * <i>closed range</i> (which includes both endpoints), and the key type
 * allows for calculation of the successor of a given key, merely request
 * the subrange from lowEndpoint to
 * successor(highEndpoint).  For example, suppose that m
 * is a map whose keys are strings.  The following idiom obtains a view
 * containing all of the key-value mappings in m whose keys are
 * between low and high, inclusive:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   SortedMap&lt;String, V&gt; sub = m.subMap(low, high+"\0");</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A similar technique can be used to generate an <i>open range</i>
 * (which contains neither endpoint).  The following idiom obtains a
 * view containing all of the key-value mappings in m whose keys
 * are between low and high, exclusive:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   SortedMap&lt;String, V&gt; sub = m.subMap(low+"\0", high);</pre>
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
